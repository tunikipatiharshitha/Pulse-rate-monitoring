# Pulse-rate-monitoring
Pulse rate monitoring system is an easy and reliable IOT system which gives measure of pulse using pulse sensor. The entire system is developed using Arduino and nodeMCU which has inbuilt Wi-Fi module helps in connecting the system to the Blynk Application. Here the pulse rating is measured using Pulse sensor in which the values are observed in Serial monitor and in Blynk App which is a modern IOT application which is operated on web and also available as mobile application. With the help of this system the pulse rate of an individual is easily known.
The pulse sensor detects the heartbeats and converts them into Analog voltage values.  The Arduino reads these Analog values through the Analog input pin.  The getBPM function can be customized based on the specifications of your pulse sensor. You may need to refer to the sensor datasheet for accurate conversion formulas. The calculated BPM value is sent to the Serial Monitor, where you can observe the pulse rate in beats per minute.
